# GameFinder

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at our software/API! This is a complete and working Product with alot of features and even some room to grow.

With our software, you can easily manage your game library. You will have the ability to add, delete, and remove any game(s) that you wish. 
Another great feature is letting your community rate the games that they have played. The rating system is based on 4 catagories (Game visuals, Gameplay, overall enjoyment, and the UI).
these 4 ratings are combined to give the users a clear average rating score (out of 10).

By default, the user will see the games in alphabetical order, but will have the ability to filter by Genre, Ratings, or just search for a specific game they have in mind. 

We plan to add many more features including a HUGE social media update. Thank you again for looking at our product!
